# Launch Kubernetes

**Wait for Kubernetes to start.**

The launch script performs the following tasks to prepare the
environment:

+ Starts Kubernetes
+ Waits for Kubernetes to be fully available
+ Copies the kubelet public key for SAT attestation verification
+ Prepares additional Katacoda-specific configuration

# Once the prompt returns, continue

**IMPORTANT: Wait for the `>>> DONE! Ready for the next step` message before
continuing. This will take a couple of minutes.**
